# Learning Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented programming OOP is a development paradigm created by Alan Kay, also author of the programming language SmallTalk. The paradigm is an approach of software development based on the concept of "objects". The code is organized in data structures called Classes or Prototype that are models for real world objects and these objects interact each other to do tasks and manipulate  data.

### Pillars
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Abstraction
Is the act of capture object essential details while hide complexity and details less relevante. It is the creation of a simplified representation of complex concept of entity from real life.
Pay Attention, in software development a Class is a representation of a object or concept from real life and an Object is a instance of a Class.
